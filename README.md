## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and recognizing faces in crowded areas such as public transport and events. The system can be used for security monitoring, crowd management, and personalized interactions.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using YOLO/SSD/MTCNN.
- Face recognition integration using models like FaceNet.
- User-friendly interface for interaction and monitoring.

## Setup and Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python face_recognition
2. Download Haar Cascade or YOLO model files for face detection.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python face_recognition
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Usage
The application will open a camera feed, detect faces, and recognize them if they are in the database.

## Impact
This system aims to enhance public safety and personal security through advanced face recognition capabilities in crowded areas.
